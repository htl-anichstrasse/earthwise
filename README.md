# Earthwise: Accessible Geographical Learning Platform

Earthwise is a project aimed at creating an accessible learning platform on the web and via smartphones. 
The primary objective is to provide people of all ages with an engaging and playful method to enhance their geographical knowledge. 
The project is divided into four main components: a website, a mobile application, a server, and a database. Both Server and Database are running on a Raspberry pi 3b+

## Features
- **Website**: A dynamic flask web application built using data from the database. It provides a user-friendly learning environment accessible freely on the internet.
- **Mobile App**: A portable learning option available for smartphones. It follows similar principles to the website, offering an interactive learning experience on the go.
- **Server**: Runs on a Raspberry Pi and acts as a link between the web and mobile applications and the database. It facilitates communication through an API.
- **Database**: Stores geographical data utilized by both the website and the mobile app.
